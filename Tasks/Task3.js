// Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t. All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

// Example 1:
// Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
// Output: true

let s = "egg", t = "add"
